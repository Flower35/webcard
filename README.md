# Smart Card Browser Extension

---

This smart card browser extension is an attempt to provide a bridge between the **JavaScript** world (*that a Web developer is familiar with*) and the **native smart card** subsystems (*available in PC platforms*).

The idea is that a Web developer, who wants to have low level access to smart cards in the machine where the browser is running, would add a **`webcard.js`** file to the page. That script would in turn check if the extension is installed, and if not, prompt the user to install it.
